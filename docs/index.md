# Instellate.Commands

A opinonated command framework for DSharpPlus

## What is this?

`DSharpPlus.Commands` wasn't the first iteration of a new official command framework for
DSharpPlus.  
The first iteration was a framework I made called `DSharpPlus.UnifiedCommands`.
I made this when I was not as experienced in C# and .NET as I am nowadays.
But cause I misunderstood what the maintainers wanted this version got rejected.

`DSharpPlus.UnifiedCommands` followed a similar design to `Instellate.Commands`
which follows a ASP.NET like approach to making commands.
Don't get me wrong, `DSharpPlus.Commands` is great. But I wanted something more opinionated.
So I started working on `Instellate.Commands` which is an opinionated command framework for
DSharpPlus
which follows the original design that I tried to PR into DSharpPlus the first time around.
